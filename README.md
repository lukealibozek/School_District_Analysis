# School_District_Analysis


For this part of the Challenge, write a report that summarizes your updated analysis and compares it with the results from the module.

The analysis should contain the following:

## Overview of the school district analysis: 

The original purpose of this analysis was to create a high-level snapshot of the school district's key metrics, key metrics by each individual school, and various other analyses to determine school performance by school budget, school size, and school type. 

The purpose of this analysis changed, however, when it was reported that the testing scores for ninth grade students at Thomas High School were allegedly altered, and rendered inadmissible. The ask then became to nullify those problematic scores, and refactor the code to not only extract the previously described key metrics, but to identify the impact that removing these grades had on the metrics.


Explain the purpose of this analysis.

A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
School performance based on the budget per student
School performance based on the school size 
School performance based on the type of school``

## Results: 

Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type
## Summary: 

Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
